## Intro

Finding parking is very challenging at our university. Most of the parking lots fill up quickly and have permit restrictions. A driver may need to travel to several parking lots before they can discover an open spot. 

Not only does this make people waste a lot of time hunting for parking, but also causes a bunch of traffic on campus. We determined that an crowd-source app that could show available spots to drivers would bring convenience to all residents and benefit our community.

## Set Up

Our app is made entirely in client-side Javascript, so starting it is very straightforward.
If using Firefox, open “index.html” and start using the application. 
If using another web browser, the process is more involved thanks to the default security settings in Chrome and Edge:

1.Install nodejs ( https://nodejs.org/en/ and click on the button labeled LTS)

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and enter “npm install -g http-server”
without quotes

3. Download the source code to a directory and open a command prompt or terminal in this
directory

4. In this command prompt or terminal, type “http-server” without quotes. 
   It should print something similar to:
	- Starting up http-server, serving ./
	- Available on:http://127.0.0.1:8080

5. In your web browser, enter “localhost:8080” in the url bar and press enter.
