## DV BLASTER v1.0
## ----------------

This code is the basis for a simple 'asteroid blaster' game. It has the
following functionality:
- 2D ship movement
- "Fire-able rockets" that can destroy asteroids they collide with
- Asteroids that can be "spawned" based on user input, and fall vertically
- Score tracking
 -- Single-session scoring (clears on refresh)
 -- Score per asteroid is inversely proportional to size (smaller==harder==more points)
- Program will randomly generate a sheid, which equals one life.
- User can also change the setting of sound, speed of the rocket

## CONTROLS

Arrow-Keys: move ship
Spacebar: fire rocket
Shift: spawn one additional asteroid

## Implementation

All code is done by the client site JavaScript
